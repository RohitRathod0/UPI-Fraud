## Alternative: Minimal Working Version

If the full app doesn't work, I can create a minimal demo version that:
- Shows the landing page
- Has a working demo interface
- Doesn't require all ML models to load
- Works immediately

**Would you like me to create this?**

## Railway Fix - Quick Steps

   - If NO → Create new project
   - If YES → Check logs for errors

## Last Resort: Static Demo

If nothing works, I can create:
